  # LOGICAL OPERATORS ARE " AND, OR, NOT ETC,"                        
# LOGICAL OF AND IS Return the answer TRUE when ALL the condition must be FULLY FILL in the Logical Operation.
# LOGICAL OF OR IS Return the answer TRUE when ATLEAST Condition must be fully filled in the True statement will be wrote.
# LOGICAL OF NOT IS Working like the they will be the convert the true to false & false to true.
# Example of all three on the both side TRUE OR FALSE SIDE.

print( 12==12 and 35>32 and 45<56 and 100>=99 and 80<= 120) # ALL THE CONDITION MUST BE TRUE.
print( 12>10 and 12>= 10 and 10 <= 15 and 15 == 16 ) # ONLY last pair of equcation is FALSE and all the answer will be FALSE.

print( 12==13 or 12>=25 or 15>=25 or 50>45) # THIS CONDITION MUST BE FULLY FILLED WHERE WE NEED THE ONE CONDITION MUST BE FULLYED THAT's why this setance must be TRUE
print( 12==13 or 12>=25 or 15>=25 or 50==45) # THIS CONDITION MUST BE FULLY FILLED WHERE WE NEED THE ONE CONDITION MUST BE FULLYED THAT's why this setance must be FALSE 

print ( 12 == 12 )   # THIS CONDITION MUST BE FULLY FILLED WHERE WE NEED THE ONE CONDITION MUST BE FULLYED THAT's why this setance must be TRUE
print (not 12==12 )  # NOW here the WE PUT THE NOT CONDITION THAT why this is false. BUT IN THE UPPER CONTION BUT BE FULLED.
